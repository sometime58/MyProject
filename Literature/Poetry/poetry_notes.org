  My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains 
  My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, 
  Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains 
  One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk 
  ’Tis not through envy of thy happy lot, 
  But being too happy in thine happiness, - 
  That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees, 
  In some melodious plot 
  Of beechen green and shadows numberless, 
  Singest of summer in full-throated ease. 
  O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been 
  Cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth, 
  Tasting of Flora and the country green, 
  Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth! 
  O for a beaker full of the warm South, 
  Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene, 
  With beaded bubbles winking at the brim, 
  And purple-stained mouth; 
  That I might drink, and leave the world unseen, 
  And with thee fade away into the forest dim: 

  Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget 
  What thou among the leaves hast never known, 
  The weariness, the fever, and the fret 
  Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; 
  Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, 
  Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies; 
  Where but to think is to be full of sorrow, 
  And leaden-eyed despairs, 
  Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes, 
  Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow. 

  Away! away! for I will fly to thee, 
  Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards, 
  But on the viewless wings of Poesy, 
  Though the dull brain perplexes and retards: 
  Already with thee! tender is the night, 
  And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne, 
  Cluster’d around by all her starry Fays; 
  But here there is no light, 
  Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown 
  Though verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways. 

  I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, 
  Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, 
  But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet 
  Wherewith the seasonable month endows 
  The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild; 
  White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine; 
  Fast fading violets cover’d up in leaves; 
  And mid-May’s eldest child, 
  The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine, 
  The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves. 

  Darkling I listen; and, for many a time 
  I have been half in love with easeful Death, 
  Call’d him soft names in many a mused rhyme, 
  To take into the air my quiet breath; 
  Now more than ever seems it rich to die, 
  To cease upon the midnight with no pain, 
  While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad 
  In such an ecstasy! 
  Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain - 
  To thy high requiem become a sod. 

  Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird! 
  No hungry generations tread thee down; 
  The voice I hear this passing night was heard 
  In ancient days by emperor and clown: 
  Perhaps the self-same song that found a path 
  Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, 
  She stood in tears amid the alien corn; 
  The same that oft-time hath 
  Charm’d magic casements, opening on the foam 
  Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. 

  Forlorn! the very word is like a bell 
  To toll me back from thee to my sole self! 
  Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well 
  As she is fam’d to do, deceiving elf. 
  Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades 
  Past the near meadows, over the still stream, 
  Up the hill-side; and now ’tis buried deep 
  In the next valley-glades: 
  Was it a vision, or a waking dream? 
  Fled is that music: - Do I wake or sleep?

*** Sleep and Poetry

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  What is more gentle than a wind in summer? 
  What is more soothing than the pretty hummer 
  That stays one moment in an open flower, 
  And buzzes cheerily from bower to bower? 
  What is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing 
  In a green island, far from all men’s knowing? 
  More healthful than the leafiness of dales? 
  More secret than a nest of nightingales? 
  More serene than Cordelia’s countenance? 
  More full of visions than a high romance? 
  What, but thee sleep? Soft closer of our eyes! 
  Low murmurer of tender lullabies 
  Light hoverer around our happy pillows! 
  Wreather of poppy buds, and weeping willows! 
  Silent entangler of a beauty’s tresses! 
  Most happy listener! when the morning blesses 
  Thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes 
  That glance so brightly at the new sun-rise.

  Though featuring the simplistic form of rhyming couplets, Keats’
  poetry expresses emotions and stimulating thoughts more inwards by
  romantic standards

*** On First Looking into Chapman's Homer 
- Content
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  Much have I travell’d in the realms of gold, 
  And many goodly states and kingdoms seen; 
  Round many western islands have I seen 
  Which bards in fealty to Apollo told 
  That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne; 
  Yet did I never breathe its pure serene 
  Till I heard Chapman speak out load and bold: 
  Then felt I like some watcher of the skies 
  When a new planet swims into his ken; 
  Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes 
  He start’d at the Pacific - and all his men 
  Look’d at each other with a wild surmise - 
  Silent, upon a peak in Darien.

*** A Late Walk 
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  When I go up through the mowing field, 
  The headless aftermath, 
  Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew, 
  Half closes the garden path. 

  And when I come to the garden ground, 
  The whir of sober birds, 
  Up from the tangle of withered weeds, 
  Is sadder than any words. 

  A tree beside the wall stands bare, 
  But a leaf that lingered brown, 
  Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought, 
  Comes softly rattling down. 

  I end not far from my going forth 
  By picking the faded blue 
  Of the last remaining aster flower 
  To carry again to you.
