<div class="org-src-container">

<pre  class="src src-org">O what can ail thee, Knight at arms, 
Alone and palely loitering? 
The sedge has withered from the Lake 
And no birds sing! 

O what can ail thee, Knight at arms, 
So haggard and so woebegone? 
The squirrel's granary is full 
And the harvest's done. 

I see a lily on thy brow 
With anguish moise and fever dew,
And on thy cheeks a fading rose 
Fast withereth too. 

I met a Lady in the Meads, 
Full beautiful, a faery's child, 
Her hair was long, her foot was light 
And her eyes were wild. 

I made a Garland for her 
And bracelets too, and fragrant zone; 
She looked at me as she did love 
And made sweet moan. 

I set her on my pacing steed 
And nothing else saw all day long, 
For sidelong would she bend and sing 
A faery's song. 

She found me roots of relish sweet, 
And honey wild, and manna dew, 
And sure in language strange she said 
'I love thee true.'

She took me to her elfin grot 
And there she wept and sighed full sore, 
And there I shut her wild wild eyes 
With kisses four. 

And there she lulled me asleep. 
And there I dreamed, Ah woe betide! 
The latest dream I ever dreamt 
On the cold hill side. 

I saw pale Kings, and Princes too, 
Pale warriors, death-pale were they all; 
They cried, 'La belle dame sans merci 
Thee hath in thrall!' 

I saw their starved lips in the gloam 
With horrid warning gaped wide, 
And i awoke, and found me here 
On the cold hill's side. 

And this is why I sojourn here, 
Alone and palely loitering. 
Though the sedge is withered from the Lake 
And no birds sing.

<pre  class="src src-org"><span style="color: #3C3C3C; background-color: #F0F0F0; font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: overline;">* Intro </span>
- This is a ballad borrowing the title of the 15th century La Belle Dame
sans Mercy by Alain Chartier but not the content. It shows
Keats'poetic preoccupation with love and death.
<span style="color: #3C3C3C; background-color: #F0F0F0; font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: overline;">* Structure </span>
- Twelve stanzas of 4 lines each in a ABCB rhyme scheme. 
- Each stanza consists of 3 iambic tetrameter lines followed by a
  final dimetric line. It gives the ballad a deliberate and slow
  movement pleasing to the ear. 
<span style="color: #3C3C3C; background-color: #F0F0F0; font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: overline;">* Style &amp; techniques </span>
- A number of stylistic characters of a ballad, including the
  simplicity of language,repetition and absence of details.
- The wintry, dire landscape builds the settings well for the
  ill-fated knight's love tragedy.

<h4 >Ode to a Nightingale</h4>
<ul >
<li>Content</li>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre  class="src src-org">My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains 
My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, 
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains 
One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk 
&#8217;Tis not through envy of thy happy lot, 
But being too happy in thine happiness, - 
That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees, 
In some melodious plot 
Of beechen green and shadows numberless, 
Singest of summer in full-throated ease. 
O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been 
Cool&#8217;d a long age in the deep-delved earth, 
Tasting of Flora and the country green, 
Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth! 
O for a beaker full of the warm South, 
Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene, 
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim, 
And purple-stained mouth; 
That I might drink, and leave the world unseen, 
And with thee fade away into the forest dim: 

Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget 
What thou among the leaves hast never known, 
The weariness, the fever, and the fret 
Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; 
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, 
Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies; 
Where but to think is to be full of sorrow, 
And leaden-eyed despairs, 
Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes, 
Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow. 

Away! away! for I will fly to thee, 
Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards, 
But on the viewless wings of Poesy, 
Though the dull brain perplexes and retards: 
Already with thee! tender is the night, 
And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne, 
Cluster&#8217;d around by all her starry Fays; 
But here there is no light, 
Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown 
Though verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways. 

I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, 
Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, 
But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet 
Wherewith the seasonable month endows 
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild; 
White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine; 
Fast fading violets cover&#8217;d up in leaves; 
And mid-May&#8217;s eldest child, 
The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine, 
The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves. 

Darkling I listen; and, for many a time 
I have been half in love with easeful Death, 
Call&#8217;d him soft names in many a mused rhyme, 
To take into the air my quiet breath; 
Now more than ever seems it rich to die, 
To cease upon the midnight with no pain, 
While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad 
In such an ecstasy! 
Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain - 
To thy high requiem become a sod. 

Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird! 
No hungry generations tread thee down; 
The voice I hear this passing night was heard 
In ancient days by emperor and clown: 
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path 
Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, 
She stood in tears amid the alien corn; 
The same that oft-time hath 
Charm&#8217;d magic casements, opening on the foam 
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn. 

Forlorn! the very word is like a bell 
To toll me back from thee to my sole self! 
Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well 
As she is fam&#8217;d to do, deceiving elf. 
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades 
Past the near meadows, over the still stream, 
Up the hill-side; and now &#8217;tis buried deep 
In the next valley-glades: 
Was it a vision, or a waking dream? 
Fled is that music: - Do I wake or sleep?

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre  class="src src-text">What is more gentle than a wind in summer? 
What is more soothing than the pretty hummer 
That stays one moment in an open flower, 
And buzzes cheerily from bower to bower? 
What is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing 
In a green island, far from all men&#8217;s knowing? 
More healthful than the leafiness of dales? 
More secret than a nest of nightingales? 
More serene than Cordelia&#8217;s countenance? 
More full of visions than a high romance? 
What, but thee sleep? Soft closer of our eyes! 
Low murmurer of tender lullabies 
Light hoverer around our happy pillows! 
Wreather of poppy buds, and weeping willows! 
Silent entangler of a beauty&#8217;s tresses! 
Most happy listener! when the morning blesses 
Thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes 
That glance so brightly at the new sun-rise.

<pre  class="src src-org">Much have I travell&#8217;d in the realms of gold, 
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen; 
Round many western islands have I seen 
Which bards in fealty to Apollo told 
That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne; 
Yet did I never breathe its pure serene 
Till I heard Chapman speak out load and bold: 
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies 
When a new planet swims into his ken; 
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes 
He start&#8217;d at the Pacific - and all his men 
Look&#8217;d at each other with a wild surmise - 
Silent, upon a peak in Darien.

<h4 >A Late Walk</h4>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre  class="src src-org">When I go up through the mowing field, 
The headless aftermath, 
Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew, 
Half closes the garden path. 

And when I come to the garden ground, 
The whir of sober birds, 
Up from the tangle of withered weeds, 
Is sadder than any words. 

A tree beside the wall stands bare, 
But a leaf that lingered brown, 
Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought, 
Comes softly rattling down. 

I end not far from my going forth 
By picking the faded blue 
Of the last remaining aster flower 
To carry again to you.
